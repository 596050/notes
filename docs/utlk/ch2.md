### **Chapter 2. Memory Addressing**

This chapter offers details in [x86](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86) microprocessors address memory chips and how Linux uses the available addressing circuits.

### Memory Addresses

* **Logical address**
* **Linear address** (also known as **virtual address**)
* **Physical address**

Memory Management Unit (MMU) transforms a logical address into a linear address, and the linear address into a physical address.

[![Figure 2-1. Logical address translation](figure_2-1_600.png)](figure_2-1.png "Figure 2-1. Logical address translation")

Memory arbiter: read or write operations on a RAM chip must be performed serially.

### Segmentation in Hardware

The following sections focus on address translation when **protected mode** is enabled, in Intel microprocessors starting with the 80286 model.

### Segment Selectors

A logical address consists of:

* **Segment Selector** (segment identifier): 16-bit
* Offset: 32-bit

### Segmentation registers

**Segmentation Registers** hold Segment Selectors.

* `cs`: code segment (program instructions); 2-bit field for CPU's Current Privilege Level (CPL), Linux uses only levels 0 and 3 for Kernel Mode and User Mode
* `ss`: stack segment (current program stack)
* `ds`: data segment (global and static data)
* `es`, `fs`, and `gs`: general purpose (arbitrary data)

### Segment Descriptors

Each segment is represented by an 8-byte **Segment Descriptor** that describes the segment characteristics. Segment Descriptors are stored either in the **Global Descriptor Table** (GDT) or in the **Local Descriptor Table** (LDT). The address and size of GDT and LDT are contained in `gdtr` and `ldtr` control registers respectively.

* Code Segment Descriptor: included in GDT or LDT
* Data Segment Descriptor: included in GDT or LDT
* Task State Segment Descriptor (TSSD): refers to a Task State Segment (TSS), a segment used to save the contents of the processor registers; included in GDT only
* Local Descriptor Table Descriptor (LDTD): refers to a segment containing an LDT; included in GDT only

### Fast Access to Segment Descriptors

Segmentation registers store only the Segment Selector. The x86 process provides an additional nonprogrammable register for each of the six programmable segmentation registers to speed up the translation of logical addresses into linear addresses. Each nonprogrammable register contains the 8-byte Segment Descriptor.

Segment Selector fields [p40]:

* `index`: identifies the Segment Descriptor entry contained in GDT or LDT
* `TI` (Table Indicator): specifies whether the Segment Descriptor is included in the GDT (`TI` = 0) or in the LDT (`TI` = 1).
* `RPL` (Requestor Privilege Level):  specifies the [Current Privilege Level](#cpl-rpl-and-registers) (CPL) of the CPU when the corresponding Segment Selector is loaded into the `cs` register

### Segmentation Unit

The **segmentation unit** performs the following operations to obtain the linear address:

[![Figure 2-5. Translating a logical address](figure_2-5.png)](figure_2-5.png "Figure 2-5. Translating a logical address")

* Examines the `TI` field of the Segment Selector to determine which Descriptor Table (GDT or LDT) stores the Segment Descriptor
* Computes the address of the Segment Descriptor from the `index` field of the Segment Selector
* Adds the offset of the logical address to the `Base` field of the Segment Descriptor

### Segmentation in Linux

All Linux processes running in User Mode use the same pair of segments to address instructions and data. This is similar to processes running in Kernel Mode.

* user code segment
* user data segment
* kernel code segment
* kernel data segment

Segment Selectors are defined by the macros:

* `__USER_CS`
* `__USER_DS`
* `__KERNEL_CS`
* `__KERNEL_DS`

To address the kernel code segment, for instance, the kernel just loads the value yielded by the `__KERNEL_CS` macro into the `cs` segmentation register.

The linear addresses associated with such segments all start at 0 and reach the addressing limit of 2<sup>32</sup> â€“1. This means that all processes, either in User Mode or in Kernel Mode, may use the same logical addresses.

#### [CPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_ring), `RPL` and registers

The Current Privilege Level (CPL) of the CPU indicates whether the processor is in User or Kernel Mode and is specified by the `RPL` field of the Segment Selector stored in the `cs` register. [p42]

Whenever the CPL is changed, some segmentation registers (e.g. `ds`, `ss`) must be correspondingly updated. [p42-43]

#### Implicit Segment Selector

Only Offset component of its logical address is specified:

* `ss`: kernel saves a pointer to an instruction or to a data structure
* `cs`: kernel invokes a function
* `ds`: kernel data structure
* `es`: user data structure

### The Linux GDT

In multiprocessor systems there is one GDT for every CPU [p43].

* [`cpu_gdt_table`](https://github.com/shichao-an/linux-2.6.11.12/blob/master/arch/i386/kernel/head.S#L479) array: stores GDTs
* [`cpu_gdt_descr`](https://github.com/shichao-an/linux-2.6.11.12/blob/master/arch/i386/kernel/head.S) array: addresses and sizes of the GDTs

Each GDT includes 18 segment descriptors and 14 null, unused, or reserved entries. Unused entries are inserted on purpose so that Segment Descriptors usually accessed together are kept in the same 32-byte line of the hardware cache.

* [Four user and kernel code and data segments](#segmentation-in-linux)
* Task State Segment (TSS)
* Default Local Descriptor Table(LDT), usually shared by all processes
* Three Thread-Local Storage (TLS) segments: allows multithreaded applications to make use of up to three segments containing data local to each thread. The `set_thread_area()` and `get_thread_area()` system calls, respectively, create and release a TLS segment for the executing process.
* Three segments related to Advanced Power Management (APM)
* Five segments related to Plug and Play (PnP) BIOS services
* A special TSS segment used by the kernel to handle "Double fault" exceptions

### The Linux LDT

Most Linux User Mode applications do not make use of a Local Descriptor Table. The kernel defines a default LDT to be shared by most processes. It has five entries but only two are used by the kernel: a [call gate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_gate) for [iBCS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Binary_Compatibility_Standard) executables, and a call gate for Solaris/x86 executables.

In some cases, processes may require to set up their own LDT, such as applications (such as Wine) that execute segment-oriented Microsoft Windows applications. The `modify_ldt()` system call allows a process to do this.

### Paging in Hardware

The paging unit translates linear addresses into physical ones. Its key task is to check the requested access type against the access rights of the linear address, and generates a Page Fault exception if memory access is not valid.

* **Pages**: grouped fixed-length intervals of linear addresses; contiguous linear addresses within a page are mapped into contiguous physical addresses. The term "page" to refer both to a set of linear addresses and to the data contained in this group of addresses.
* **Page frames** (or **physical pages**): RAM partitions from the perspective of the paging unit. Each page frame (storage area) contains a page (block of data), thus the length of a page frame coincides with that of a page.
* **Page table**: data structures (in main memory) that map linear to physical addresses

### Regular Paging

The x86 processors support paging; it is enabled by setting the `PG` flag of a control register named `cr0`.

### Doubts and Solutions

Segmentation in Linux [p41]
> However, Linux uses segmentation in a very limited way. In fact, segmentation and paging are somewhat redundant, because both can be used to separate the physical address spaces of processes: segmentation can assign a different linear address space to each process, while paging can map the same linear address space into different physical address spaces. Linux prefers paging to segmentation for the following reasons:
